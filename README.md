Fan made site for Mortal Kombat X that takes inspiration from game sites that list characters and gameplay info.
I need to try working with media queries to make the pages scale better when screen size is changed.
This project was made to practice different layout styles and to practice my HTML and CSS skills while also creating a site with various web pages attached to it.
